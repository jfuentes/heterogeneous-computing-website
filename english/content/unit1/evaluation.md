## Heterogeneous computing

1. Moore's law refers to: (7 points)
    - The doubling of the frequency in processors from time to time
    - The linear increase in the number of cores in a processor
    - The doubling of the number of transistors in processors from time to time
    - The increase in power generated by a processor from time to time

2. The number of accesses per unit of time is called: (7 points)
    - Bandwidth
    - Computation cycles
    - Latency
    - Cache hit

3. The idea of using memory hierarchy in modern processors is based on: (7 points)
    - Avoid conflicts between cores or computing units
    - Ease the access load of DRAM memory
    - Accelerate data accesses by using SRAM memories close to the computing units
    - Increase the storage capacities by adding SRAM

4. Order the memories according to the access speeds from a CPU: (14 points)
    - DRAM
    - L3
    - Registers
    - L2
    - Hard drive
    - L1

5. Select which type of memory corresponds to each description: (14 points)
    | Description                                   |  SRAM   |  DRAM   |
    | --------------------------------------------- | :------:| :-----: |
    | Less expensive                                | &#9744; | &#9744; |
    | Faster access                                 | &#9744; | &#9744; |
    | Uses more transistors                         | &#9744; | &#9744; |
    | Requires refreshing memory                    | &#9744; | &#9744; |
    | Is located closer to the processor            | &#9744; | &#9744; |
    | Also known as main memory                     | &#9744; | &#9744; |

6. What coherence protocol was applied in the following scenario on a multi-core CPU? (7 points)

    > In a quad core CPU there are 4 threads running independently in each of the cores. The task that threads perform is to update positions of a shared array in main memory. When a thread changes a value of a certain position of the array, immediately a process is in charge of updating all the copies of that position of the array in the caches of the other cores.

    - Snooping
    - Update
    - Invalidate

7. Select the characteristics in common that Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs have: (7 points)

    - [ ] Architecture based on many small cores (or computing units) clustered
    - [ ] Cores or computational units more complex than CPU
    - [ ] Can run hundreds or thousands of threads in parallel
    - [ ] Include cache-based memory hierarchy

8. What can a programmer define in an FPGA? (7 points)

    - [ ] The size of its internal memory
    - [ ] The functionality of logic blocks
    - [ ] Establish interconnection routes between logic blocks
    - [ ] The number of transistors on the chip
    - [ ] Set the clock and reset
